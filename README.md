Title: Nutri-Score Calculator for UK Food Products

Description:
This project aims to create a Nutri-Score calculator for food products available in the United Kingdom. Nutri-Score is a nutrition label that provides at-a-glance information about the nutritional quality of a food product. The purpose of this project is to help consumers make healthier food choices by categorizing products and calculating their Nutri-Score based on various nutritional attributes. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this tool offers an interactive interface for users to search and evaluate different food products, promoting informed dietary decisions.

2. Introduction:
In today's fast-paced world, making healthy food choices is crucial for maintaining overall well-being. However, understanding the nutritional content of various food products can be challenging for consumers. The Nutri-Score calculator project addresses this challenge by providing an intuitive platform for users in the UK to assess the nutritional quality of food items effortlessly. By categorizing products and calculating Nutri-Score based on key nutritional factors, this project empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their diet, promoting healthier lifestyles and contributing to improved public health.

3. Technologies Used:
Python: The project is implemented using the Python programming language.
Pandas: Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis, facilitating the handling of the dataset.
scikit-learn: The scikit-learn library is utilized for machine learning tasks, including imputation and regression modeling.
HistGradientBoostingRegressor: This regressor from scikit-learn is employed for model-based imputation of missing values in the dataset.
LabelEncoder: LabelEncoder from scikit-learn is used to encode categorical variables into numerical format.
openpyxl: The openpyxl engine is utilized to read Excel files, enabling seamless data ingestion.
This project showcases the intersection of data science and nutrition, offering a practical solution to enhance public awareness about the nutritional content of food products. Through the application of machine learning algorithms and interactive user interfaces, it bridges the gap between complex nutritional data and everyday consumers, encouraging healthier dietary choices in the United Kingdom.
